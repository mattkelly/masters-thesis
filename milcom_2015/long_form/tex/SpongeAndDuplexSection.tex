\section{Sponge Construction}
\label{sec:SpongeAndDuplex}
The sponge construction is a relatively new cryptographic primitive that has gained popularity since \Keccak won the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-3) competition in 2013 \cite{Bertoni2011_KeccakReference}\cite{NIST2012_SHA3_Winner}.
Essentially, it provides a way to generalize hash functions (which normally have outputs of fixed length) to functions with arbitrary length output.
This generalization allows cryptographic sponges to be used for applications other than hashing.

Sponges are based on the iteration of an underlying function $f$.
This function can either be a general \emph{transformation} or a \emph{permutation}.
A transformation need not be bijective; that is, it may not be invertible.
A permutation is bijective and thus invertible by definition.
The security proofs are different for transformations and permutations, and there are advantages and disadvantages for each choice of a function type \cite{Bertoni2011_SpongeFunctions}.

\subsection{Sponge Parameters}
The output $Z$ of the parameterized sponge construction is given as
\begin{equation*}
\label{eq:SpongeOutput}
Z = \mathbf{sponge}[f,\mathbf{pad},r](M,\ell),
\end{equation*}
where $\mathbf{pad}$ is a padding function for the input, $r$ is the \emph{rate} of absorption, $M$ is the message (or other input) data, and $\ell$ is the desired output length.
The sponge construction is stateless; there is no information stored between calls to it.

Figure~\ref{fig:Sponge} shows the sponge construction.
It is split into two distinct phases: the \emph{absorbing} phase and the \emph{squeezing} phase.
Inputs (e.g.\ message and/or key material) are absorbed in the first phase and the output (e.g.\ a MAC or keystream) is squeezed out in the second phase.

\label{fig:Sponge}
\end{figure}

The state of the sponge construction is split into two contiguous portions: the \emph{outer state}, which is accessible externally, and the \emph{inner state}, which is hidden.
The size of the outer state is given by the \emph{rate} $r$ and the size of the inner state is specified by the \emph{capacity} $c$.
The size of the entire state is $b = r + c$.
The speed of the construction partially relies on the rate, while the security is partially dependent on the capacity.

The padding function $\mathbf{pad}$ is first applied to $M$ to make it a multiple of $r$.
$M$ is then absorbed $r$ bits at a time.
More concretely, absorption is the process of XORing $r$-bit blocks into the state while interleaving with applications of the underlying sponge function $f$.
If the rate is increased then more bits are absorbed at a time and thus the construction runs faster.
However, increasing the rate means that the capacity must decrease and so there is a clear trade-off between speed and security.
Squeezing consists of concatenating $r$ bits at a time to an output bitstring $Z$ that is truncated to $\ell$ bits.
The sponge function $f$ must be called once for each $r$ bits of output after the first full block.

\subsection{Sponge Applications}
\label{sec:SpongeApplications}
The sponge construction can be used for many applications beyond hashing without modification.
The applications listed in this section are of considerable relevance to the ultimate goal of efficient authenticated encryption.
Note that the sponge construction is particularly attractive here (and in general with keyed modes) because to the sponge, there is no differentiation between the key, initialization vector (IV), and message data.
All input data is treated exactly the same, and thus the design remains simple.
This is in great contrast to traditional symmetric key cryptosystem design in which a key schedule is required.

\subsection{MAC Generation}
A Message Authentication Code (MAC) function is essentially a keyed hash function.
In this case, $K||IV$ (the key concatenated with an initialization vector) is absorbed first and then the padded message is absorbed directly after.
The output is squeezed $r$ bits at a time until the desired length of the MAC is reached.

\subsection{Bitstream Encryption}
A MAC generation function built from a sponge construction is characterized by long absorbing phases (assuming a long message) and short squeezing phases.
Bitstream encryption, i.e.\ using the sponge as a stream cipher, is characterized oppositely: absorbing is quick while squeezing is likely a much longer process.
For this application, we simply absorb $K||IV$ and switch to the squeezing phase immediately.
Squeezing continues until a keystream is no longer needed.
The keystream is XORed with the message to produce the ciphertext.

\subsection{Generic Security}
The security of the sponge construction is based on the assumption that the underlying sponge function $f$ is secure.
That is, if $f$ is indistinguishable from random then so should be the sponge construction it is instantiated within.
Consequently, cryptographers designing a system based on the sponge construction need only be concerned with designing and cryptanalyzing a secure underlying function.
The sponge construction, when used properly, is said to be secure against \emph{generic attacks} -- attacks which do not exploit any specific properties of the underlying sponge function.
We call this the \emph{generic security} of the construction \cite{Bertoni2011_SpongeFunctions}.

The generic security of keyed constructions is higher than unkeyed.
For our purposes we are interested only in the security of the keyed sponge construction where a permutation is used for $f$. 
Jovanovic et.~al\ \cite{Jovanovic2014_Beyond} proved in 2014 that the generic security level of keyed sponge constructions is lower bounded by 
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{min}(2^{(r+c)/2}, 2^c, 2^{|K|}).
\end{equation*}

% SECTION:Duplex Construction
%------------------------------
\section{Duplex Construction}
The duplex construction is highly related to the sponge construction.
The main differences are that the duplex construction maintains state between calls and that there no longer exists a clear separation between the absorbing and squeezing phases.
Absorbing and squeezing happen essentially at the same time, hence ``duplexing''.
The duplex mode has several applications, with authenticated encryption being the one of obvious interest to us.

\subsection{Duplex Parameters}
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/Duplex.pdf}
\caption{The duplex construction $\mathbf{duplex}[f,\mathbf{pad},r]$ \cite{Bertoni2011_SpongeFunctions}}
\label{fig:Duplex}
\end{figure}
Parameters for the duplex construction are mostly the same as for the sponge construction.
However, since the duplex construction maintains state, we build a \emph{duplex object} $D$ and make calls to it.
The function which processes inputs and produces outputs is called $\mathbf{duplexing}$:
\begin{equation*}
Z_i = D.\mathbf{duplexing}(\sigma_i,\ell_i)
\end{equation*}

Figure~\ref{fig:Duplex} shows the duplex construction.
The $i$-th input is denoted $\sigma_i$ and the $i$-th output is denoted $Z_i$, which is truncated to $\ell_i$ bits.
Inputs are absorbed and processed at the same time that outputs are squeezed.
For a duplex object it is possible to have an empty input or to not request an output.
A \emph{blank call} is a call to $\mathbf{duplexing}$ for which no input is provided ($|\sigma_i| = 0$).
A \emph{mute call} is a call for which no output is requested ($\ell_i = 0$).

\subsection{Duplex for Authenticated Encryption}
Authenticated encryption is easily achieved using the duplex construction.
Figure~\ref{fig:DuplexAE_Expanded} shows such a use case.
First, we construct a duplex object $D$.
Then we absorb $K$ (or optionally $K||IV$) using one or more mute calls to $D.\mathbf{duplexing}$.
More that one mute call may be required if the length of the key exceeds the rate $r$.
We denote a header input to $D$ as $A$; these arbitrary length inputs are authenticated but not encrypted.
We denote a body input to $D$ as $B$; these arbitrary length inputs are both encrypted and authenticated.
$A$ inputs are absorbed using one or more mute calls to $D.\mathbf{duplexing}$.
$B$ inputs are absorbed in a similar fashion and then the keystream $Z$ is XORed with $B$ to produce the ciphertext $C$.
The tag $T$ is produced using a blank call to $D.\mathbf{duplexing}$ after all header and body inputs have been processed.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/DuplexAE_Expanded-BW.png}
\caption{The duplex construction as used for authenticated encryption \cite{Bertoni2010_DuplexingSlides}}
\label{fig:DuplexAE_Expanded}
\end{figure}

For example, the body $B$ consists of three blocks of size $r$ and so it requires three calls to be completely absorbed.
An intermediate tag is requested after the first header and body pair is processed and before the next header begins.
This is a very typical use case for e.g.\ network traffic.
The tag can be of arbitrary length.

Clearly, the ciphertext and tags produced at any point depend on all of the previous inputs to $D$.
Intermediate tags can be produced if desired, since blank calls can be made at any time.
In summary, using the duplex construction for authenticated encryption provides the following advantages:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Easy to use
\item Single key required
\item Single-pass for encryption and authentication
\item Support for intermediate tags
\item Support for Additional Authenticated Data (AAD, or headers)
\item Secure against generic attacks
\item Ability to trade off speed and security by adjusting $r$
\end{enumerate}

We note that the duplex construction may require \emph{domain separation}, a generic mechanism for eliminating output ambiguity.
For example, domain separation may simply consist of appending a \emph{frame bit} that alternates in value to the end of every input in order to demarcate different data types.

\subsection{Security}
\label{sec:DuplexSecurity}
A reduction is used to prove the security of the duplex construction.
Any calls made to the duplex construction can be reduced to calls to the keyed sponge construction.
Therefore the security of the duplex depends on the security of the corresponding sponge, which can be shown to be secure against generic attacks.
For a rigorous proof, we refer to \cite{Bertoni2012_Duplexing}.
