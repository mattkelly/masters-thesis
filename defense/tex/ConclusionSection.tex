\frametitle{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item AE is an extremely popular and important topic right now
  \item We provide our own novel solution
  \item Provides nearly all desired properties of AE:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Easy to use
    \item Single key, single pass
    \item Header support
    \item Intermediate MACs
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Easily} customizable on per-user / application basis
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Actual hardware implementation
  \item More cryptanalysis - always
  \item Complete analysis of all 16-bit S-boxes by Wood
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Easier customization
  \end{itemize}
  \item Find larger matrices with maximum branch number (MDS matrices)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Decrease rounds
  \end{itemize}
  \item Much more!
\end{itemize}
